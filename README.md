# Machine Learning 

## Overview 
Machine Learning : This repository contains materials and implementations related to Statistical Learning, inspired by the book Introduction to Statistical Learning in R (ISLR) by **Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani**. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhur006/Machine_Learning.git
   cd Machine_Learning
   ```
2. Explore the notebooks for each analysis.
